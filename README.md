## usage
To use Foresight you will need to source it in your env file

So if you are using zsh you would add . ~/path/to/foresight.sh to your .zshrc file.
Basically the same instructions for bash just in your .bashrc file.

Then you will have FORESIGHT as a command that you can run from your console!
